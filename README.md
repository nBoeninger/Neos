# Project Neos
Project Neos is a collection of C/C++ Libraries. Are there faster librariers ? Yes. Are the more flexiable librariers ? Of course. But this is mine and i enjoy working on it :)
The first goal of Neos is to power my private project with an esp32 ÂµC. But i intend to expand everything for diffrent hardware at some point.
Suggestion, Comments or Ideas are always welcome.


## Vision
The Vision of Neos is to support the devlopment of embedded systems. The Neos Project can be used as a base project, providing some libraries I find usefull for developing embedded software.
The Structure of the Project:

app/
   --> The application Software
lib/
   --> Third Party libariers like googleTest
neos/
   --> The collection of Neos libraries

When Starting an new Project with Neos simply create a Project containing the app folder. Then add the Neos Project as a submodule.

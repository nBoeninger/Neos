# Project Neos
Project Neos is a collection of C/C++ Libraries.

## Vision
The Vision of Neos is to support the devlopment of embedded systems. The Neos Project can be used as a base project, providing some libraries I find usefull for developing embedded software.
The Structure of the Project:

app/
   --> The application Software
lib/
   --> Third Party libariers like googleTest
neos/
   --> The collection of Neos libraries

When Starting an new Project with Neos simply create a Project containing the app folder. Then add the Neos Project as a submodule.
